# Security Skill

Specialized skill for security verification and vulnerability detection.

## When to Use

- Code security vulnerability scanning (SQL Injection, XSS, CSRF)
- Sensitive data detection (API keys, passwords, tokens)
- Input validation verification
- Prompt injection defense
- Dependency vulnerability checks
- API security review (authentication/authorization)

## Security Gates

- Critical/High vulnerabilities: 0
- Sensitive data exposure: 0
- Prompt injection block rate: 100%
- Unsafe code patterns: 0
