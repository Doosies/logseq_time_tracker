# System Improvement Skill

Specialized skill for agent system performance analysis and automatic optimization.

## When to Use

- Analyzing agent performance metrics
- Detecting workflow bottlenecks
- Running A/B tests for rule changes
- Optimizing agent rules and skills
- Generating performance reports
- Monitoring system health trends

## Trigger Conditions

- Performance degradation >= 10%
- 3+ consecutive failures
- Bottleneck importance exceeding threshold
- Weekly summary generation
